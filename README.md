# C Piscine Projects at 42 Paris

This repo includes all but the last two projects C12 and C13 (due to time I spent and failed on C10).

All but C10 and Rush02 received full mark 100/100.

- **C10**: I still do not know why it didn't pass on the last exercise (*ft_hexdump*) even after looking at the trace notes. It seemed to be working and passed all of my test cases. Otherwise, other exercises are correct
- **Rush02**: The corrector found some corner cases where I haven't handled accordingly to the subjects (rules of input files, extra empty lines, etc...) otherwise under normal circumstances and correct inputs, the program outputs correct results

Other notes:
- All subjects are in ***French only***
- The **Rush00** contains only the part of my group, which didn't give bonus points. Consider adding other exercises as bonus once your own exercise is done perfectly
- The **Rush01** and **BSQ** include two Python scripts called `mapgen.py` which help generating random maps for testing purposes
- Codes look ugly on GitHub but ok-ish on IDEs. Don't blame me, it's the Norminette's fault
